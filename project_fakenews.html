<h1><A NAME = "1"><b>Fake News Detection: Discourse-Aware Methods and Resources</b></h1> 

</p>

<p align="justify">In the last few years, there was a growth in the number of web and social media users. Consequently, the potential of 
 deceptive activities also increased, resulting in the production of fake news, fake reviews (also known as opinion spam), deceptive discussion, 
 simple lies, etc. Fake news detection is defined as the prediction of the chances of a particular news article being intentionally deceptive 
 (Rubin et al., 2015). Moreover, statements that are intentionally misstated (or manipulated) are of considerable interest to researchers, government,
 security, and financial systems. According to deception literature, there are reliable cues for detecting deception and the belief that liars give off 
 cues that may indicate their deception is near-universal. Therefore, in this research project, we propose to examine discourse structure patterns
 from deceptive and truthful stories, as well as building and evaluating computational discourse-aware methods for cross-language deception detection 
 on the web and social media.
