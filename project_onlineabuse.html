       Language is often used to discriminate, attack and terrorize people. Moreover, through language which stereotypes and prejudices are 
        communicated and perpetuated (Field et all, 2021). Although the study on race and language is a relevant research topic, there is a significant 
        lack of research concerning <b>racist language in Natural language processing</b>. To fill this important research gap, and due to severity 
        of social media abusive comments in Latin America, as well as and the lack of research in Brazilian Portuguese and Latin America Spanish,
        this ongoing research investigates and provides methods and resources for racist hate speech detection for the Brazilian Portuguese and 
        Latin America language.

        In this project, we create the <b>first large-scale expert annotated dataset in Brazilian Portuguese for abusive language detection</b>. HateBR is 
        composed of 7,000 Instagram comments annotated with three different levels: binary classification (offensive versus non-offensive; 
        offense-levels, such as highly, moderately, and weakly offensive, and eleven hate targets). Moreover, we propose a new multilingual model
        for offensive language and hate speech detection on social media, as well as evaluate classic and sophisticated machine learning algorithms 
        for these tasks using the proposed dataset. Our approach obtained an 88% F1 score, which is currently the baseline for the Portuguese language.
        At last, a new resource was proposed, which consists of the first multilingual offensive lexicon (MOL) composed of 1,000 explicit and implicit
        pejorative terms and expressions annotated with contextual information. MOL is currently available for Portuguese, English, Spanish.
