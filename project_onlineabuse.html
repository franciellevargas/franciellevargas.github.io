<h1><A NAME = "2"><b>Detecting Online Abuse and Harm in Latin America: Methods and Resources Towards Mitigating Racial Bias</b></h1> 

</p> 


In this project, we create the first large-scale expert annotated dataset in Brazilian Portuguese for abusive language detection. HateBR is composed of 7,000 Instagram comments annotated with three different levels: binary classification (offensive versus non-offensive; offense-levels, such as highly, moderately, and weakly offensive, and eleven hate targets). Moreover, we propose a new multilingual model for offensive language and hate speech detection on social media, as well as evaluate classic and sophisticated machine learning algorithms for these tasks using the proposed dataset. Our approach obtained an 88% F1 score, which is currently the baseline for the Portuguese language. At last, a new resource was proposed, which consists of the first multilingual offensive lexicon (MOL) composed of 1,000 explicit and implicit pejorative terms and expressions annotated with contextual information. MOL is currently available for Portuguese, English, Spanish, French, German and Turkish.
