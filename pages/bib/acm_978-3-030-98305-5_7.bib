abstract = {Although very useful, aspect-based sentiment analysis shows several challenges. The occurrence of implicit aspects is one of them. To improve our understanding of implicit aspects, this work analyzes their composition and categorizes the implicit aspect clues found in two corpora of opinionated texts of different domains in the Portuguese language. As results of this work, in addition to the implicit aspect typology, we present four lexicons of implicit aspect clues for different domains and the annotation of implicit aspect clues in an existing corpus.},
